            <h2>My childhood.</h2>
            <p>When I was six (back in the Windows 95 era), our family got a computer that had a 10 gigabyte hard drive (HDD), 256 bit color, a mouse, keyboard, and—best of all—a CD ROM. One of my favorite experiences was installing new software; my eyes were glued to the screen with eager anticipation as the progress bar went from 0 to 100%.</p>

                <p>Back a few months ago, I asked Emily (my significant other) what she likes about me. Her response was more-or-less "…because you talk nerdy to me." I think this is evidence enough that I should marry her.</p>
                <p>It’s also where the slogan for this site comes from.</p>

            <h2>My university experience.</h2>
            <p>Fast-forward a few years. I got home from serving a mission in Utah (pretty foreign, I know) and decided to go to university to get a degree and find myself. After switching majors four times in four semesters, I landed on my favorite field of studies—computers—specifically web design and development.</p>
            <p>This is year five of studying at a university for me. It’s a love-hate relationship. Mostly love and a little hate. The blog and tutorial portion of this site is pretty much dedicated to that: my journey through the technology field. Hopefully your journey will be just as much fun as mine has been.</p>

            <h2>Now that we know each other, let’s have a DTR (define the relationship).</h2>
            <p>Here’s what you can anticipate on the blog portion of the site:
            <ol>
                <li>lessons learned from past mistakes (not a confession!),</li>
                <li>recommended places to start for various fields, </li>
                <li>career forecasting (keep in mind I’m not a licensed meteorologist), and </li>
                <li>my most prevalent, gratuitous, or recent frustrations with web design or development (there are many).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I’ll make my best effort to not use this as a medium for brain barf or venting. Besides, I don’t think I’m ready to make that kind of commitment to you. Sorry. It’s not you, it’s me.</p>

            <h2>Wisdom from a 26-year OLD MAN.</h2>
            <p>Before I let you go, keep in mind this treasured wisdom from a future father (well I will be someday). Web development is a lot like raising kids. You'll be pulling your hair out half the time, but the sense of fulfillment of seeing a dynamic web site pull together is priceless. If you decide to put that into a fortune cookie, make sure that you spell my name correctly—'Guenther' is spelled with an 'e'.</p>
            <p>Meteorologist or not, I have a lot to say. So stick around.</p>
